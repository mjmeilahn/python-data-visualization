# Python Jupyter Notebook
Notebook of all data science projects

1. Simple example of how the Python language is able to crunch large numbers for the purpose of data analysis.

2. Simple example of how data is arranged "The Python Way" for analysis. Basic imports, loops, conditionals, and appending data into lists. While this is not an exhaustive illustration there are many methods to crunch data before and after using Python.

3. Exploring Matplotlib charts for visualization. Fake data is organized into dictionaries and lists, then converted to Numpy Arrays. These visualizations show NBA Free Throw Attempts Per Game, Accuracy of Free Throws and Player playing style preference between 2005 - 2013. Assigns one color to each basketball player to understand data trends; legend included to interpret visualizations faster.
