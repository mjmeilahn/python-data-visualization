# Python Jupyter Notebook
Notebook of all data science projects

1. Exploring Matplotlib charts for visualization. Fake data is organized into dictionaries and lists, then converted to Numpy Arrays. These visualizations show NBA Free Throw Attempts Per Game, Accuracy of Free Throws and Player playing style preference between 2005 - 2013. Assigns one color to each basketball player to understand data trends; legend included to interpret visualizations faster.

2. Segmenting data by custom filters and/or attaching labels to dimensional data. Also creating new rows/columns based on programatic interaction with other data. Exploring Seaborn library in grander visualizations not possible with Matplotlib e.g. Boxplot and Scatter Plot.

3. Full dive into Seaborn library and its available visualizations. Imports fake dataset via Pandas for easy segmentation and/or filtering. Assigns dimensional data as categories instead of numbers.
